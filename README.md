# Software-Engineering-Metric-Visualisation

**Note**

The GitHub version does not include the access tokens required by the application to interact with the GitHub API and MongoDB Atlas.
Any valid GitHub access token embedded in the code is automatically revoked by GitHub once the source code is uploaded to the repository.

For the GitHub version, the access tokens have been replaced by placeholders in file /DataVis/src/apps/global_vars.py at lines 24 and 25.
